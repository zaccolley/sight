Content warnings help some people prepare or avoid certain content. An example may be: "violence", "mental health" or "food".

Not going to argue whether content warnings are useful in this post. They're helpful for me and for others too.

Also I know these are hard to do, and I've messed up by not even checking talks in the past.

## Potential problem I see at events

I often see content warnings at the very start of a talk.

Imagine this scenario:
1. You've sat down amongst an audience of many people
1. You're told a content warning by a speaker. It's something you want to avoid
1. You want to get up and leave. But doing this  tells everyone in that room what you're thinking

This could out people as LGBTQIA+, or dealing with specific trauma that they want to be private to them. Ironically that person has to sit there and deal with the content.

## When to announce content warnings

These are my rough thoughts but I think the following times might be useful:

+ **In the event description** - on the website announcing the website. After the talk summary put a list of content warnings. Teach your speakers about content warnings and ask them to give you a list. You could also suggest some if you're reviewing the talks too.
+ **At the start of the event** - this could be a great way to remind people and also give people chance to organise themselves. If they want to skip the third talk, now they can work that out!
+ **At breaks between talks** - if you have breaks then again a reminder can help
+ **Before the talk itself** - still good to have, and very useful to have the speaker put the context in too

## What do you think?

I'd love to hear from people who find content warnings useful and also event organisers. What do you think?
